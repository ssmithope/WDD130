        <p>Hello! My name is Smith Eutrope Zephirin, and I am from Haiti. I enjoy biking, and taking a walk.
            Most of the time I stay home due to tasks and another responsibility. I love to see the Temple
            as well, I know going to the Temple can bless me and my family. My family and I are recently moved to the United States,
            after attending the Church, the first place we decided to spend time, was the Temple. We wish to visit more Temple as soon as we can.
            Going to the Temple bring many blessings, we love the Temple. Actually, I think my studies are moving faster than I 
            was expected, want to stay focus in continuing my education, I have good instructor and peer mentor, I think making a three years degree,
            is ever one of the most important for a student, that's a good decision. I will always pray to find guidance and comprehesion.
        </p>
